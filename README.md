# SliceOfHeaven ASP.NET MVC Project

SliceOfHeaven is an ASP.NET MVC project that I created. Originally a class project to create an e-commerce page, my goal was to create a functional pizza-store website, demonstrating my abilities in ASP.NET.

## Notable Features

- Fully Functional Ordering System: Customize pizzas with various toppings before checkout.

- User Authentication: Secure registration and login system. Login with Google via API.

- Role-based Authorization: Different access levels based on user roles. Customers can create a new pizza. Admin users can add new topping options, view customer orders, etc. 

- Stripe API Payment Integration: Seamless payment processing using the Stripe API. Currently in test mode, so feel free to try it out.

## Demonstration

Check out a hosted version at [https://sliceofheaven2.azurewebsites.net/](https://sliceofheaven2.azurewebsites.net/) Azure's free hosting speed leaves something to be desired, but it still serves as a fully functional demonstration. Feel free to create a user account of your own or to use `test@test.ca` with password `Test123!`
